##Generating simulated data 

```{r}
source_DIR = "~/Desktop/scDDboost/simulation/splatter_data/synData.R"
source(source_DIR)

root_DIR = "~/Downloads/data/"
save_DIR = "~/Desktop/"

params = est_param(root_DIR, 10)
loc = -2
scale = 5
group_prob <- c(0.3,0.2,0.1,0.15,0.05,0.05,0.15)
synData(loc, scale, params, group_prob, save_DIR,
                    nrep = 2, Seed = 10,
                    ncells = 400, de_prob = 0.1)

```


synthesized data is at (save_DIR).
