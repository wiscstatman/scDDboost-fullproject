Hi Professor Newton,

Yes, the splatter paper only presents the flowchart for simulating data for one group. So all the parameters in the terminology are estimated internally by those empirical data sets splatter used. 

Those parameters theta and gamma we used in the main are different, they refer to the location and scale parameters controlling the DE level.

In the splatter paper, they gave a brief description of how they simulating multiple groups in the "Simulating group" section, but they did not specifically denote those parameters used to stimulate DE genes.

Reference for the theta and gamma we used can be found in the splatter paper github site, 

https://github.com/Oshlack/splatter-paper/blob/master/analysis/clustering.Rmd

and 

https://github.com/Oshlack/splatter-paper/blob/master/analysis/simulations.Rmd

where they name those parameters as de.facLoc and de.facScale. Those codes are used to reproduce the result in splatter paper,  so we pick those 2 default pairs of theta and gamma since splatter argued they gave authentic simulated data under some criterion. 
But we also notice that the evidence of a true DE gene being different across conditions on such settings is very weak that all methods have low power, so we amplify the DE genes by making another 2 pairs of theta and gamma via (-0.1,0.3)[default] -> (-0.1,1)  
and (0.1,0.4)[default] ->(0.3,0.5). Just for the sake of having better resolution comparing different methods. Thanks
