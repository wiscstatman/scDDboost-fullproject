    abstract = "{Advances in high-throughput sequencing on single-cell gene expressions [single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)] have enabled transcriptome profiling on individual cells from complex samples. A common goal in scRNA-seq data analysis is to discover and characterise cell types, typically through clustering methods. The quality of the clustering therefore plays a critical role in biological discovery. While numerous clustering algorithms have been proposed for scRNA-seq data, fundamentally they all rely on a similarity metric for categorising individual cells. Although several studies have compared the performance of various clustering algorithms for scRNA-seq data, currently there is no benchmark of different similarity metrics and their influence on scRNA-seq data clustering. Here, we compared a panel of similarity metrics on clustering a collection of annotated scRNA-seq datasets. Within each dataset, a stratified subsampling procedure was applied and an array of evaluation measures was employed to assess the similarity metrics. This produced a highly reliable and reproducible consensus on their performance assessment. Overall, we found that correlation-based metrics (e.g. Pearson?s correlation) outperformed distance-based metrics (e.g. Euclidean distance). To test if the use of correlation-based metrics can benefit the recently published clustering techniques for scRNA-seq data, we modified a state-of-the-art kernel-based clustering algorithm (SIMLR) using Pearson?s correlation as a similarity measure and found significant performance improvement over Euclidean distance on scRNA-seq data clustering. These findings demonstrate the importance of similarity metrics in clustering scRNA-seq data and highlight Pearson?s correlation as a favourable choice. Further comparison on different scRNA-seq library preparation protocols suggests that they may also affect clustering performance. Finally, the benchmarking framework is available at http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/SMS/bioinformatics/software.html.}",

	Abstract = {The Pearson test statistic is constructed by partitioning the data into bins and computing the difference between the observed and expected counts in these bins. If the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the original data is used, the statistic generally does not follow a chi-squared distribution or any explicit distribution. We propose a bootstrap-based modification of the Pearson test statistic to recover the chi-squared distribution. We compute the observed and expected counts in the partitioned bins by using the MLE obtained from a bootstrap sample. This bootstrap-sample MLE adjusts exactly the right amount of randomness to the test statistic, and recovers the chi-squared distribution. The bootstrap chi-squared test is easy to implement, as it only requires fitting exactly the same model to the bootstrap data to obtain the corresponding MLE, and then constructs the bin counts based on the original data. We examine the test size and power of the new model diagnostic procedure using simulation studies and illustrate it with a real data set.},

In this paper, we develop new analytical methods that account for the intrinsic, stochastic nature of single cell expression in order to characterize the effect of cell cycle on gene expression at the single-cell level. Applying these methods to populations of asynchronously cycling cells, we are able to identify large numbers of genes with cell cycle-associated expression patterns. By measuring and adjusting for cellular-level factors, we are able to derive estimates of co-expressing gene networks that more closely reflect cellular-level processes as opposed to sample-level processes. We find that cell cycle phase only accounts for a modest amount of the overall variability of gene expression within an individual cell. The analytical methods demonstrated in this paper are universally applicable to single cell expression data and represent a promising tool to the scientific community.},

@article{Newton:2004aa,
	Abstract = {Mixture modeling provides an effective approach to the differential expression problem in microarray data analysis. Methods based on fully parametric mixture models are available, but lack of fit in some examples indicates that more flexible models may be beneficial. Existing, more flexible, mixture models work at the level of one‐dimensional gene‐specific summary statistics, and so when there are relatively few measurements per gene these methods may not provide sensitive detectors of differential expression. We propose a hierarchical mixture model to provide methodology that is both sensitive in detecting differential expression and sufficiently flexible to account for the complex variability of normalized microarray data. EM‐based algorithms are used to fit both parametric and semiparametric versions of the model. We restrict attention to the two‐sample comparison problem; an experiment involving Affymetrix microarrays and yeast translation provides the motivating case study. Gene‐specific posterior probabilities of differential expression form the basis of statistical inference; they define short gene lists and false discovery rates. Compared to several competing methodologies, the proposed methodology exhibits good operating characteristics in a simulation study, on the analysis of spike‐in data, and in a cross‐validation calculation.},

@article{Muralidharan:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Many statistical problems involve data from thousands of parallel cases. Each case has some associated effect size, and most cases will have no effect. It is often important to estimate the effect size and the local or tail-area false discovery rate for each case. Most current methods do this separately, and most are designed for normal data. This paper uses an empirical Bayes mixture model approach to estimate both quantities together for exponential family data. The proposed method yields simple, interpretable models that can still be used nonparametrically. It can also estimate an empirical null and incorporate it fully into the model. The method outperforms existing effect size and false discovery rate estimation procedures in normal data simulations; it nearly acheives the Bayes error for effect size estimation. The method is implemented in an R package (mixfdr), freely available from CRAN.},

	Abstract = {Modern scientific technology has provided a new class of large-scale simultaneous inference problems, with thousands of hypothesis tests to consider at the same time. Microarrays epitomize this type of technology, but similar situations arise in proteomics, spectroscopy, imaging, and social science surveys. This paper uses false discovery rate methods to carry out both size and power calculations on large-scale problems. A simple empirical Bayes approach allows the false discovery rate (fdr) analysis to proceed with a minimum of frequentist or Bayesian modeling assumptions. Closed-form accuracy formulas are derived for estimated false discovery rates, and used to compare different methodologies: local or tail-area fdr's, theoretical, permutation, or empirical null hypothesis estimates. Two microarray data sets as well as simulations are used to evaluate the methodology, the power diagnostics showing why nonnull cases might easily fail to appear on a list of "significant" discoveries.},

@article{Haghverdi:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Single-cell technologies have recently gained popularity in cellular differentiation studies regarding their ability to resolve potential heterogeneities in cell populations. Analyzing such high-dimensional single-cell data has its own statistical and computational challenges. Popular multivariate approaches are based on data normalization, followed by dimension reduction and clustering to identify subgroups. However, in the case of cellular differentiation, we would not expect clear clusters to be present but instead expect the cells to follow continuous branching lineages.Results: Here, we propose the use of diffusion maps to deal with the problem of defining differentiation trajectories. We adapt this method to single-cell data by adequate choice of kernel width and inclusion of uncertainties or missing measurement values, which enables the establishment of a pseudotemporal ordering of single cells in a high-dimensional gene expression space. We expect this output to reflect cell differentiation trajectories, where the data originates from intrinsic diffusion-like dynamics. Starting from a pluripotent stage, cells move smoothly within the transcriptional landscape towards more differentiated states with some stochasticity along their path. We demonstrate the robustness of our method with respect to extrinsic noise (e.g. measurement noise) and sampling density heterogeneities on simulated toy data as well as two single-cell quantitative polymerase chain reaction datasets (i.e. mouse haematopoietic stem cells and mouse embryonic stem cells) and an RNA-Seq data of human pre-implantation embryos. We show that diffusion maps perform considerably better than Principal Component Analysis and are advantageous over other techniques for non-linear dimension reduction such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding for preserving the global structures and pseudotemporal ordering of cells.Availability and implementation: The Matlab implementation of diffusion maps for single-cell data is available at https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb/single-cell-diffusion-map.Contact:fbuettner.phys{\char64}gmail.com, fabian.theis{\char64}helmholtz-muenchen.deSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	N2 = {Abstract DNA microarrays provide for unprecedented large-scale views of gene expression and, as a result, have emerged as a fundamental measurement tool in the study of diverse biological systems. Statistical questions abound, but many traditional data analytic approaches do not apply, in large part because thousands of individual genes are measured with relatively little replication. Empirical Bayes methods provide a natural approach to microarray data analysis because they can significantly reduce the dimensionality of an inference problem while compensating for relatively few replicates by using information across the array. We propose a general empirical Bayes modelling approach which allows for replicate expression profiles in multiple conditions. The hierarchical mixture model accounts for differences among genes in their average expression levels, differential expression for a given gene among cell types, and measurement fluctuations. Two distinct parameterizations are considered: a model based on Gamma distributed measurements and one based on log-normally distributed measurements. False discovery rate and related operating characteristics of the methodology are assessed in a simulation study. We also show how the posterior odds of differential expression in one version of the model is related to the ratio of the arithmetic mean to the geometric mean of the two sample means. The methodology is used in a study of mammary cancer in the rat, where four distinct patterns of expression are possible. Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Substantial statistical research has recently been devoted to the analysis of large-scale microarray experiments which provide a measure of the simultaneous expression of thousands of genes in a particular condition. A typical goal is the comparison of gene expression between two conditions (e.g., diseased vs. nondiseased) to detect genes which show differential expression. Classical hypothesis testing procedures have been applied to this problem and more recent work has employed sophisticated models that allow for the sharing of information across genes. However, many recent gene expression studies have an experimental design with several conditions that requires an even more involved hypothesis testing approach. In this paper, we use a hierarchical Bayesian model to address the situation where there are many hypotheses that must be simultaneously tested for each gene. In addition to having many hypotheses within each gene, our analysis also addresses the more typical multiple comparison issue of testing many genes simultaneously. We illustrate our approach with an application to a study of genes involved in obstructive sleep apnea in humans.},

	N2 = {Survivin is the first apoptosis inhibitor described to date to be expressed in G2-M in a cell cycle-dependent manner and to directly associate with mitotic spindle microtubules. To gain additional insights into this novel apoptotic checkpoint, we have now characterized the mouse survivin locus. Hybridization screening of mouse BAC libraries identified a survivin gene containing four exons and three introns, spanning \&gt;50 kb on the telomere of chromosome 11E2 and generating a 0.85-kb mRNA versus the 1.9-kb human transcript. A mouse survivin protein of 140 amino acids (Mr ∼16,200 ) was 84{\%} identical to its human orthologue and contained a structurally unique single baculovirus iap repeat (BIR) and a -COOH-terminus coiled domain instead of a RING finger. Analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse survivin gene revealed a TATA-less promoter containing a canonical CpG island, numerous Sp1 sites, two cell cycle-dependent elements (CDEs), and one cell cycle gene homology region (CHR), typically found in G2-M-expressed genes. Primer extension and S1 nuclease mapping identified three transcription start sites at position −32, −36, and −40 from the initiating ATG. Transfection of survivin promoter-luciferase constructs identified a minimal promoter region within the most proximal 174 bp upstream of the first ATG. Mutagenesis of the CDE/CHR elements and Sp1 sites in this region, alone or in combination, reduced transcriptional activity by 40--60{\%} in asynchronously growing cells and abolished cell cycle periodicity in G2-M-synchronized cells. These data demonstrate that cell cycle expression of survivin requires integration of typical CDE/CHR G1 repressor elements and basal transcriptional activity by Sp1. Disruption of these transcriptional requirements may provide an alternative strategy to block the overexpression of survivin in cancer. {\copyright}1999 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	Abstract = {Summary Signaling proteins display remarkable cell-to-cell heterogeneity in their dynamic responses to stimuli, but the consequences of this heterogeneity remain largely unknown. For instance, the contribution of the dynamics of the innate immune transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) to gene expression output is disputed. Here we explore these questions by integrating live-cell imaging approaches with single-cell sequencing technologies. We used this approach to measure both the dynamics of lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-κB activation and the global transcriptional response in the same individual cell. Our results identify multiple, distinct cytokine expression patterns that are correlated with NF-κB activation dynamics, establishing a functional role for NF-κB dynamics in determining cellular phenotypes. Applications of this approach to other model systems and single-cell sequencing technologies have significant potential for discovery, as it is now possible to trace cellular behavior from the initial stimulus, through the signaling pathways, down to genome-wide changes in gene expression, all inside of a single cell.},

Teicher {$[$}5{$]$} has initiated a valuable study of the identifiability of finite mixtures (these terms to be defined in the next section), revealing a sufficiency condition that a class of finite mixtures be identifiable and from this, establishing the identifiability of all finite mixtures of one-dimensional Gaussian distributions and all finite mixtures of gamma distributions. From other considerations, he has generalized {$[$}4{$]$} a result of Feller {$[$}1{$]$} that arbitrary (and hence finite) mixtures of Poisson distributions are identifiable, and has also shown binomial and uniform families do not generate identifiable mixtures. In this paper it is proven that a family F of cumulative distribution functions (cdf's) induces identifiable finite mixtures if and only if F is linearly independent in its span over the field of real numbers. Also we demonstrate that finite mixtures of F are identifiable if F is any of the following: the family of n products of exponential distributions, the multivariate Gaussian family, the union of the last two families, the family of one-dimensional Cauchy distributions, and the non-degenerate members of the family of one-dimensional negative binomial distributions. Finally it is shown that the translation-parameter family generated by any one-dimensional cdf yields identifiable finite mixtures.{$]$}},

	Abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer in adults and is notoriously difficult to treat because of its diffuse nature. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 3,589 cells in a cohort of four patients. We obtained cells from the tumor core as well as surrounding peripheral tissue. Our analysis revealed cellular variation in the tumor's genome and transcriptome. We were also able to identify infiltrating neoplastic cells in regions peripheral to the core lesions. Despite the existence of significant heterogeneity among neoplastic cells, we found that infiltrating GBM cells share a consistent gene signature between patients, suggesting a common mechanism of infiltration. Additionally, in investigating the immunological response to the tumors, we found transcriptionally distinct myeloid cell populations residing in the tumor core and the surrounding peritumoral space. Our data provide a detailed dissection of GBM cell types, revealing an abundance of information about tumor formation and migration.},

	Abstract = {Single-cell sequencing can illuminate the genetic properties of brain cancers and reveal heterogeneity within a tumor. Patel et al. examined the genome sequence of single cells isolated from brain glioblastomas. The findings revealed shared chromosomal changes but also extensive transcription variation, including genes related to signaling, which represent potential therapeutic targets. The authors suggest that the variation in tumor cells reflects neural development and that such variation among cancer cells may prove to have clinical significance.Science, this issue p. 1396 Human cancers are complex ecosystems composed of cells with distinct phenotypes, genotypes, and epigenetic states, but current models do not adequately reflect tumor composition in patients. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to profile 430 cells from five primary glioblastomas, which we found to be inherently variable in their expression of diverse transcriptional programs related to oncogenic signaling, proliferation, complement/immune response, and hypoxia. We also observed a continuum of stemness-related expression states that enabled us to identify putative regulators of stemness in vivo. Finally, we show that established glioblastoma subtype classifiers are variably expressed across individual cells within a tumor and demonstrate the potential prognostic implications of such intratumoral heterogeneity. Thus, we reveal previously unappreciated heterogeneity in diverse regulatory programs central to glioblastoma biology, prognosis, and therapy.},

@article{Trapnell,
	Abstract = {Defining the transcriptional dynamics of a temporal process such as cell differentiation is challenging owing to the high variability in gene expression between individual cells. Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation.},

For example, assaying the genomes of multiple cells during development reveals developmental lineage trees---the kinship lineage---whereas cellular transcriptomes inform us about the regulatory state of cells and their gradual restriction in potency---the Waddington lineage. Beyond that, the comparison of single-cell data across species allows evolutionary changes to be tracked at all stages of development from the zygote, via different kinds of stem cells, to the differentiating cells. We discuss recent insights into the evolution of stem cells and initial attempts to reconstruct the evolutionary cell type tree of the mammalian forebrain, for example, by the comparative analysis of neuron types in the mesencephalic floor. These studies illustrate the immense potential of single-cell genomics to open up a new era in developmental and evolutionary research. },

Here, we introduce CIDR (Clustering through Imputation and Dimensionality Reduction), an ultrafast algorithm that uses a novel yet very simple implicit imputation approach to alleviate the impact of dropouts in scRNA-seq data in a principled manner. Using a range of simulated and real data, we show that CIDR improves the standard principal component analysis and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, namely t-SNE, ZIFA, and RaceID, in terms of clustering accuracy. CIDR typically completes within seconds when processing a data set of hundreds of cells and minutes for a data set of thousands of cells. CIDR can be downloaded at                   https://github.com/VCCRI/CIDR                                  .},

	Abstract = {Single-cell RNA-seq data allows insight into normal cellular function and various disease states through molecular characterization of gene expression on the single cell level. Dimensionality reduction of such high-dimensional data sets is essential for visualization and analysis, but single-cell RNA-seq data are challenging for classical dimensionality-reduction methods because of the prevalence of dropout events, which lead to zero-inflated data. Here, we develop a dimensionality-reduction method, (Z)ero (I)nflated (F)actor (A)nalysis (ZIFA), which explicitly models the dropout characteristics, and show that it improves modeling accuracy on simulated and biological data sets.},

	Abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at                   http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html                                  .},

@article{ref:MAST,
	Abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics reveals gene expression heterogeneity but suffers from stochastic dropout and characteristic bimodal expression distributions in which expression is either strongly non-zero or non-detectable. We propose a two-part, generalized linear model for such bimodal data that parameterizes both of these features. We argue that the cellular detection rate, the fraction of genes expressed in a cell, should be adjusted for as a source of nuisance variation. Our model provides gene set enrichment analysis tailored to single-cell data. It provides insights into how networks of co-expressed genes evolve across an experimental treatment. MAST is available at                   https://github.com/RGLab/MAST                                  .},

@article{ref:scDD,
	Abstract = {The ability to quantify cellular heterogeneity is a major advantage of single-cell technologies. However, statistical methods often treat cellular heterogeneity as a nuisance. We present a novel method to characterize differences in expression in the presence of distinct expression states within and among biological conditions. We demonstrate that this framework can detect differential expression patterns under a wide range of settings. Compared to existing approaches, this method has higher power to detect subtle differences in gene expression distributions that are more complex than a mean shift, and can characterize those differences. The freely available R package scDD implements the approach.},

Here, we present the Splatter Bioconductor package for simple, reproducible, and well-documented simulation of scRNA-seq data.

@article{ref:Cq,
	Abstract = {Background: As single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is becoming increasingly common, the amount of publicly available data grows rapidly, generating a useful resource for computational method development and extension of published results. Although processed data matrices are typically made available in public repositories, the procedure to obtain these varies widely between data sets, which may complicate reuse and cross-data set comparison. Moreover, while many statistical methods for performing differential expression analysis of scRNA-seq data are becoming available, their relative merits and the performance compared to methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data are not sufficiently well understood. Results: We present conquer, a collection of consistently processed, analysis-ready public single-cell RNA-seq data sets. Each data set has count and transcripts per million (TPM) estimates for genes and transcripts, as well as quality control and exploratory analysis reports. We use a subset of the data sets available in conquer to perform an extensive evaluation of the performance and characteristics of statistical methods for differential gene expression analysis, evaluating a total of 30 statistical approaches on both experimental and simulated scRNA-seq data. Conclusions: Considerable differences are found between the methods in terms of the number and characteristics of the genes that are called differentially expressed. Pre-filtering of lowly expressed genes can have important effects on the results, particularly for some of the methods originally developed for analysis of bulk RNA-seq data. Generally, however, methods developed for bulk RNA-seq analysis do not perform notably worse than those developed specifically for scRNA-seq.},

	Abstract = {A Bayesian approach to the problem of comparing two multinomial distributions with k categories and a natural ordering of the categories is developed. Assuming independent Dirichlet priors, we obtain a convenient algorithm for computing the posterior probability that one distribution is stochastically larger than the other. The important special case k = 2 reduces to computing the posterior probability that one binomial proportion exceeds another. We consider the more general problem of finding the posterior distribution of the ratio of two such proportions.},

@article{Deng193,
	Abstract = {Although genetic traits are often dominant or recessive, the impact of the same heterozygous genotype can vary quite a bit between individuals. Deng et al. (p. 193), analyzed global gene expression in hundreds of individual mouse cells and found that a substantial fraction of the genes only expressed one of the alleles, chosen randomly, at any given point in time. Such stochasticity in transcription increases the heterogeneity among cells and likely contributes to the phenotypic variance among individuals of identical genotype. Expression from both alleles is generally observed in analyses of diploid cell populations, but studies addressing allelic expression patterns genome-wide in single cells are lacking. Here, we present global analyses of allelic expression across individual cells of mouse preimplantation embryos of mixed background (CAST/EiJ {\texttimes} C57BL/6J). We discovered abundant (12 to 24\%) monoallelic expression of autosomal genes and that expression of the two alleles occurs independently. The monoallelic expression appeared random and dynamic because there was considerable variation among closely related embryonic cells. Similar patterns of monoallelic expression were observed in mature cells. Our allelic expression analysis also demonstrates the de novo inactivation of the paternal X chromosome. We conclude that independent and stochastic allelic transcription generates abundant random monoallelic expression in the mammalian cell.},
