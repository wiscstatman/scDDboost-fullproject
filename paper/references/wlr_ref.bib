@article{DES,
	Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing assays such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq or barcode counting provide quantitative readouts in the form of count data. To infer differential signal in such data correctly and with good statistical power, estimation of data variability throughout the dynamic range and a suitable error model are required. We propose a method based on the negative binomial distribution, with variance and mean linked by local regression and present an implementation, DESeq, as an R/Bioconductor package.},

@article{cancer,
	Abstract = {Single-cell sequencing (SCS) is a powerful new tool for investigating evolution and diversity in cancer and understanding the role of rare cells in tumor progression. These methods have begun to unravel key questions in cancer biology that have been difficult to address with bulk tumor measurements. Over the past five years, there has been extraordinary progress in technological developments and research applications, but these efforts represent only the tip of the iceberg. In the coming years, SCS will greatly improve our understanding of invasion, metastasis, and therapy resistance during cancer progression. These tools will also have direct translational applications in the clinic, in areas such as early detection, noninvasive monitoring, and guiding targeted therapy. In this perspective, I discuss the progress that has been made and the myriad of unexplored applications that still lie ahead in cancer research and medicine.},

@article{dv,
	Abstract = { The recent flood of single-cell data not only boosts our knowledge of cells and cell types, but also provides new insight into development and evolution from a cellular perspective. For example, assaying the genomes of multiple cells during development reveals developmental lineage trees---the kinship lineage---whereas cellular transcriptomes inform us about the regulatory state of cells and their gradual restriction in potency---the Waddington lineage. Beyond that, the comparison of single-cell data across species allows evolutionary changes to be tracked at all stages of development from the zygote, via different kinds of stem cells, to the differentiating cells. We discuss recent insights into the evolution of stem cells and initial attempts to reconstruct the evolutionary cell type tree of the mammalian forebrain, for example, by the comparative analysis of neuron types in the mesencephalic floor. These studies illustrate the immense potential of single-cell genomics to open up a new era in developmental and evolutionary research. },

@article{CIDR,
	Abstract = {Most existing dimensionality reduction and clustering packages for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data deal with dropouts by heavy modeling and computational machinery. Here, we introduce CIDR (Clustering through Imputation and Dimensionality Reduction), an ultrafast algorithm that uses a novel yet very simple implicit imputation approach to alleviate the impact of dropouts in scRNA-seq data in a principled manner. Using a range of simulated and real data, we show that CIDR improves the standard principal component analysis and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, namely t-SNE, ZIFA, and RaceID, in terms of clustering accuracy. CIDR typically completes within seconds when processing a data set of hundreds of cells and minutes for a data set of thousands of cells. CIDR can be downloaded at                   https://github.com/VCCRI/CIDR                                  .},

Dimensionality reduction of such high-dimensional data sets is essential for visualization and analysis, but single-cell RNA-seq data are challenging for classical dimensionality-reduction methods because of the prevalence of dropout events, which lead to zero-inflated data. Here, we develop a dimensionality-reduction method, (Z)ero (I)nflated (F)actor (A)nalysis (ZIFA), which explicitly models the dropout characteristics, and show that it improves modeling accuracy on simulated and biological data sets.},

	Abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at                   http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html                                  .},

Our model provides gene set enrichment analysis tailored to single-cell data. It provides insights into how networks of co-expressed genes evolve across an experimental treatment.

We present a novel method to characterize differences in expression in the presence of distinct expression states within and among biological conditions. We demonstrate that this framework can detect differential expression patterns under a wide range of settings. Compared to existing approaches, this method has higher power to detect subtle differences in gene expression distributions that are more complex than a mean shift, and can characterize those differences. The freely available R package scDD implements the approach.},

@article{ref:Cq,
	Abstract = {Background: As single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is becoming increasingly common, the amount of publicly available data grows rapidly, generating a useful resource for computational method development and extension of published results. Although processed data matrices are typically made available in public repositories, the procedure to obtain these varies widely between data sets, which may complicate reuse and cross-data set comparison. Moreover, while many statistical methods for performing differential expression analysis of scRNA-seq data are becoming available, their relative merits and the performance compared to methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data are not sufficiently well understood. Results: We present conquer, a collection of consistently processed, analysis-ready public single-cell RNA-seq data sets. Each data set has count and transcripts per million (TPM) estimates for genes and transcripts, as well as quality control and exploratory analysis reports. We use a subset of the data sets available in conquer to perform an extensive evaluation of the performance and characteristics of statistical methods for differential gene expression analysis, evaluating a total of 30 statistical approaches on both experimental and simulated scRNA-seq data. Conclusions: Considerable differences are found between the methods in terms of the number and characteristics of the genes that are called differentially expressed. Pre-filtering of lowly expressed genes can have important effects on the results, particularly for some of the methods originally developed for analysis of bulk RNA-seq data. Generally, however, methods developed for bulk RNA-seq analysis do not perform notably worse than those developed specifically for scRNA-seq.},

@article{Deng193,
	Abstract = {Although genetic traits are often dominant or recessive, the impact of the same heterozygous genotype can vary quite a bit between individuals. Deng et al. (p. 193), analyzed global gene expression in hundreds of individual mouse cells and found that a substantial fraction of the genes only expressed one of the alleles, chosen randomly, at any given point in time. Such stochasticity in transcription increases the heterogeneity among cells and likely contributes to the phenotypic variance among individuals of identical genotype. Expression from both alleles is generally observed in analyses of diploid cell populations, but studies addressing allelic expression patterns genome-wide in single cells are lacking. Here, we present global analyses of allelic expression across individual cells of mouse preimplantation embryos of mixed background (CAST/EiJ {\texttimes} C57BL/6J). We discovered abundant (12 to 24\%) monoallelic expression of autosomal genes and that expression of the two alleles occurs independently. The monoallelic expression appeared random and dynamic because there was considerable variation among closely related embryonic cells. Similar patterns of monoallelic expression were observed in mature cells. Our allelic expression analysis also demonstrates the de novo inactivation of the paternal X chromosome. We conclude that independent and stochastic allelic transcription generates abundant random monoallelic expression in the mammalian cell.},
